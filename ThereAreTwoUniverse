There is the wheeler dewitt equation.
The Überuniverse it these equation.
If you dont believe in "God" then these Überuniverse is a Schrödinger Cat and nobody can ever open the box.
So there is no need for the Kopenhagener Interpretation at all. No need for the first decoherence. 
In the Überuniverse there is no time and space. These are just parts of our universe. We are just one solution of these.
And if there is no time and space the Überuniverse is only "calculating" our universe. Because every other universe/solution
will be there and will not be ther at the same "time". We are the solution that will never "end" somehow. 
And we are only some "as if" because nobody can open the Überuniverse "Schrödinger Cat Box". 

But there are two universe. One with antimatter and one with matter.
