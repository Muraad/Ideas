#### Type 1

If we reach some point where the earth cannot give more to us, like resources and stuff.
Maybe if we reach somewhere between 20Billions and 100Billion people, we will destroy each other with a big war.
Or maybe the nature will find a way maybe via some crazy virus or something.

#### Type 2 

The clinical society. We control birth of kids. Somehow like in the film "Demolition man".
Everything is controled. 

#### Type 3 

Reach to the stars. Spread out the "human cancer" to the whole universe. Build big space ships. 


We should work on every three ways at the same time. We should build backup spaceships.
Maybe we are in some kind of Type 1 society. But you have to understand these are not three steps or somethings.
Just three differnt ways how the humanity is evolving or could evolve.

Transhumanism could bring us to some Type 2 society. That will probably scare lots of people.


Work in progress.
