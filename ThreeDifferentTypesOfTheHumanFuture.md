I had this idea when i was thinking about the simple fact that the humans get children and that we become more and more.
Only what i have simply called Type 2 is throwing this fact away. They want to control this simple fact.

I came to the conclusion that there are three different types when i was talking about it with some friends. 
Then i realized there are different kinds of people who naturally prefere one of the ways.
One of my colleges for example once said when i was talking about getting children he is thinking about to not get some kids
he said "I am thinking about to not get some children. And we are already to much"




#### Type 1

If we reach some point where the earth cannot give more to us, like resources and stuff.
Maybe if we reach somewhere between 20Billions and 100Billion people, we will destroy each other with a big war.
Or maybe the nature will find a way maybe via some crazy virus or something.

#### Type 2 

The clinical society. We control birth of kids. Somehow like in the film "Demolition man".
Everything is controled. 

#### Type 3 

Reach to the stars. Spread out the "human cancer" to the whole universe. Build big space ships. 


We should work on every three ways at the same time. We should build backup spaceships.
Maybe we are in some kind of Type 1 society. But you have to understand these are not three steps or somethings.
Just three differnt ways how the humanity is evolving or could evolve.

Transhumanism could bring us to some Type 2 society. That will probably scare lots of people.

I am a Type 3 human. I just want the humanity to survive everything. And i want the humanity to spread to the univers.
Endlessly.

Work in progress.
